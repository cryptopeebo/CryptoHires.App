**Greetings, Star Traveler!** As you venture through the vast expanse of the fintech universe, you'll come across our beacon - CryptoHires! This astral platform is the nexus where customers encounter fintech luminaries. The twist? Our customers can shower these stars with cryptocurrency as a token of appreciation! 🌟

Your cosmic quest is to meld the Ethereum blockchain network with CryptoHires, crafting pathways for instant cryptocurrency rewards. Embrace the vision of a CryptoHires aficionado to concoct and validate the code that lights up crypto payments to the fintech luminaries.

## Astral Arsenal 🌌

Your celestial voyage orbits around two Python scripts nestled within the starter star cluster:

1. `crypto_jobs.py` - This cosmic script cradles the code for our application's star interface, resonating with the Streamlit constellation. Your challenge? Infuse this with your own stellar codes.

2. `crypto_wallet.py` - A treasure trove of Ethereum transaction functions. By merging this with `crypto_jobs.py`, you'll propel the platform to automate tasks like fashioning a digital wallet, charting Ethereum account balance constellations, and plotting transaction courses in the Ganache galaxy.

## Stellar Objectives 🚀

* Forge a new Ethereum account entity using Ganache's galactic mnemonic seed phrase.
* Chart and project the balance constellation of your Ethereum account beacon.
* Calculate the Ethereum transaction's celestial worth, accounting for the gas nebula, rewarding a CryptoHires luminary.
* Sign and launch a transaction in the Ethereum cosmos, rewarding a fintech star.
* Scan the transaction hash beacon linked with the authenticated cosmic transaction.

To immortalize your astral journey, capture screenshots of the Ganache galaxy detailing your transactions, and archive them in your `README.md` logbook within your GitHub space station.

## Cosmic Chronicles 🌠

This odyssey unfolds in three cosmic phases:

* Meld Ethereum Transaction Functions into CryptoHires Universe
* Sign and Launch the Stellar Reward
* Peer into the Ganache Galaxy

### Phase 1: Meld Ethereum Transaction Functions into CryptoHires Universe 🪐

Your first quest is to interlace wallet functionalities into our universe. Integrate several cosmic functions from `crypto_wallet.py` into `crypto_jobs.py`. For a detailed star map, consult the "Instructions" section in the mission guide.

### Phase 2: Sign and Launch the Stellar Reward 🌟

During this phase, you'll weigh a fintech luminary's worth in ether. This calculation orbits around the talent's hourly rate and their time spent illuminating projects. Next, empower customers to shower their chosen talent with Ether, sealing the reward with their digital signature.

### Phase 3: Peer into the Ganache Galaxy 🌌

With your celestial tools in place, it's time to test-fly your creation. Release a test transaction using the star interface, then trace this transaction's comet tail in Ganache. The mission guide holds the secrets to this astral dance.


## Galactic Dispatch 🌠

Once you've charted your course and your odyssey reaches its zenith, anchor your findings to your GitHub space station and relay the coordinates to Bootcamp Space HQ.

Remember, CryptoHires' destiny as the North Star of fintech platforms lies in your hands! Safe travels, and may the cosmos guide your path!
